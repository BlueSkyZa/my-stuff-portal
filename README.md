# MyStuffPortal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

Took my most of the weekend and a bit on Monday morning to get this far.

I didnt get to writing unit tests unfortunately. First time trying out the Material Design Tree component, which I think is pretty cool, however it took quite a bit more time than I anticipated to get it working the way I wanted.

To make this a real project, it needs a database and while the tree looks cool it isn't designed to handle more than a couple of hundred items at most, so if big data is needed something else would have to be used there.

There are two projects, this one, My Stuff Portal, which is a pure Angular 8 website and My Stuff API which is a pure node service used by this website for data services.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
